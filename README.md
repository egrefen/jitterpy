# jitterpy
Code for dumping and analysing info about pings.

Currently only supports Mac OS X's implementation of ping (due to the `--apple-time` flag).

## Installation

Copy/link `jitter.py` to a folder on your `PATH`, renaming where appropriate. For example:

```bash
clone git@github.com:egrefen/jitterpy.git
ln -s jitterpy/jitter.py ~/.local/bin/jitter
```

We will assume you've done this in the examples below.

## Usage

See `jitter -h` for full docs.
